        <strong>Background and what prompted you to take this class</strong><br />
        I went into college initially wanting to pursue finance. I coded a bit in high school and was mostly
        self-taught through online resources, but I was more interested in what you can do with computer
        science and technology more than the actual act of sitting down and coding itself, which is why I
        didn't originally plan to study CS in college. However, after taking formal CS classes here at WashU, I
        found that I really liked the community of people interested in tech, and the problem-solving process
        is satisfying to me. Now, as a Business and CS student, I'm especially interested in the intersection
        of business, tech, and design. This leads to why I want to take this class - because I want to develop
        a strong foundation in interaction design to effectively build products that are both functional and
        aesthetic.

      <li>
        <strong>Experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript</strong><br />
        Yes. I learned to use HTML/CSS in 5th grade and built my first website then. I started using JavaScript
        and frameworks like React and React Native as a junior in high school. I enjoy using React because it's
        modular and structured around making components, which means the code I write is very readable and easy
        to maintain. One of my favorite websites I coded from scratch using React is the one I made for WashU's
        Women in CS club (<a href="https://www.wics.wustl.edu/">https://www.wics.wustl.edu/</a>).
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>One thing you hope to learn in this class</strong><br />
        I already have coding experience and like to build visually appealing websites, but sometimes my design
        choices feel a bit arbitrary. I want to learn interaction design concepts and understand how to apply
        those concepts when I'm coding, and I want to develop a more structured approach to make usable,
        well-designed apps and websites.

      <li>
        <strong>One way designing for screen differs from designing for paper</strong><br />
        A sheet of paper has fixed dimensions and the content is static, while the apps and websites you see on
        a screen have to adapt to different devices and screen sizes. This means you need to design the content
        to be responsive, and you also need to think about how the user can scroll, tap, and interact with the
        content on a screen in ways that they wouldn't with a design printed on paper.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Website that exemplifies effective design</strong><br />
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17-pro/">https://www.apple.com/iphone-17-pro/</a><br />
        The Apple iPhone 17 Pro website has strong storytelling and it looks very balanced. They use consistent
        styling throughout, clear text hierarchy, and high-quality photos with bold, bright colors to create a
        polished aesthetic and convey Apple's brand. It's also very interactive and feels tactile since there
        are horizontal scrolls and various buttons and menus you can click into and expand to learn more about
        the iPhone 17 Pro's features.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Website that exemplifies effective communication</strong><br />
        <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits</a><br />
        At the top of the website, they clearly feature the book cover and immediately establish credibility
        with glowing five-star reviews from well-known authors and public figures like Mark Manson and Arianna
        Huffington. Information is presented in a structured, step-by-step way that guides users towards
        purchasing the book and backing that up with bonus guides and cheat sheets, a video of James Clear
        giving a talk to help the user put a face to the author and provide a preview of what the book is
        about, as well as the “Praise for Atomic Habits section” where more quotes are featured. Overall, the
        website is very organized. Even though there's a lot of information on the page, it's structured in a
        logical way and it makes you want to buy the book.

      <li>
        <strong>Website that works well</strong><br />
        <a href="https://partiful.com/events">https://partiful.com/events</a><br />
        Partiful makes it super easy to plan events and manage the events you're going to and the ones you've
        already attended. Once you open up the website, you can easily toggle between different event
        categories such as upcoming events, events you're hosting, and past events. You can also search for a
        specific event and click into the profiles of everyone attending an event. I also really like how
        customizable each invitation is. You have a lot of control over the font, background, and effect you
        want to use to make every invite feel unique. Partiful also recently introduced a “cards” feature so
        you can send notes to your friends that are expressive and show thought while being so easy to create.
