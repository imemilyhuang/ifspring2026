        <h2>Title: Foolproof Macaron Recipe</h2>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>French macarons are delicate almond meringue cookies with crisp shells and soft, chewy centers. While they're known for being tricky, using a Swiss meringue makes the batter more stable and reliable. This method simplifies the process and gives perfectly smooth, chewy macarons every time. </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p><strong>For the macarons</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>100g egg whites</li>
          <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
          <li>100g almond flour</li>
          <li>100g powdered sugar</li>
          <li>Pinch of salt</li>
          <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For the filling</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
          <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 300°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
          <li>Heat a small pot of water over medium-low heat until it steams. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine egg whites and roughly 3 tablespoons of the granulated sugar. Place bowl over steaming pot, creating a double boiler.</li>
          <li>Whisk egg whites and sugar continuously until sugar melts completely and egg whites become white and frothy, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and place the bowl back onto the stand mixer.</li>
          <li>Fit stand mixer with whisk attachment and whisk on high speed while slowly adding in the remaining granulated sugar. Add the food coloring (if using). Continue to whisk for another 3-4 minutes, until stiff meringue peaks form. Congratulations, you just made a Swiss meringue!</li>
          <li>Next, sift together the almond flour, powdered sugar, and salt twice, then gently shake the mixture into the meringue bowl.</li>
          <li>Place the bowl back onto a stand mixer, still fitted with a whisk attachment. Turn the mixer to medium speed and whisk for 5 seconds (just enough to combine the almond flour mixture with the egg whites).</li>
          <li>Stop the mixer and use a large spatula to hand-mix the batter for the remainder of your mixing. You'll want to gently fold the mixture with your spatula, scooping up the batter from the outside of the bowl and gently twisting it into the center in a circle-like manner. You'll know to stop mixing when you can make a figure-eight out of the dripping batter without the batter breaking. If you cannot yet make a figure-eight, repeat the process if necessary, and try the figure-eight again. The best way to describe the perfect consistency is like slow moving lava. It should give, but only slightly, like in slow-motion.</li>
          <li>Once your batter is the correct consistency, scoop it into a large pastry bag fitted with a 1 inch tip. Pipe silver dollar-sized circles onto prepared baking sheets, keeping about 1.5 inches between each meringue. Bang baking sheet on counter two times to remove any air bubbles. Sprinkle tops with a little sea salt as a garnish.</li>
          <li>Let the macarons air dry for 15 to 30 minutes or until dry to the touch. Just pop them into the prepared oven for 13 minutes, turning around halfway through, then allow to cool completely before removing from baking sheets.</li>
          <li>While the macarons are cooling, make the filling. Combine all filling ingredients in a bowl and use an electric mixer to beat until fluffy and fully combined, about 2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Scoop mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 1/2 inch tip and set aside until ready to assemble the macarons.</li>
          <li>Once the macarons are completely cool to the touch, pipe the filling onto a macaron and sandwich with another macaron. Repeat with all macarons.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
          <li>Images provide an appealing visual, and the website uses images to clearly lay out the ingredients needed for the recipe and to walk you through each step</li>
          <li>The "Jump to recipe" button takes you straight to the recipe and past the introductory paragraphs for anyone who wants to skip, and there is a video at the top to walk you through how to make the cake</li>
          <li>The "Keep Screen Awake" toggle prevents the device from going to sleep while your hands are messy, and the 1/2x, 1x, and 2x toggle helps you quickly adjust how many servings you want to make</li>
          <li>Critique — The page is pretty long due to the images spacing out all the steps, so it's easy to lose track of where you are</li>
          <li>Critique — The ingredients are all at the top, while the steps are below that in one column, so to go back and forth between the ingredients and the steps, you have to scroll</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/taiwanese-night-market-style-pork-and-chive-dumplings">Taiwanese Night Market Style Pork and Chive Dumplings - Tasty</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Red tags at the top make it clear exactly what categories the recipe falls into, so the user gets a general sense of the vibe of the recipe, and the brief but descriptive overview of the recipe gives the user context</li>
          <li>There are quick options to share or print the recipe, and the two column layout of ingredients on the left and steps on the right is effective, ensuring all the important information is visible on one screen without having to scroll</li>
          <li>The "Add items to My Cart" button removes the pain of having to find all the ingredients yourself</li>
          <li>Critique — No images/lack of visual to guide you through the steps</li>
          <li>Critique — After reading the recipe instructions more closely, I realized that some of the steps are pretty long, and they could probably be broken up so that it's easier to follow</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Great visuals, the images help you visualize what each step is supposed to look like</li>
          <li>I like how the ingredients list has checkboxes next to each ingredient so you can keep track of everything as you're preparing the cake batter/ganache/whipped cream</li>
          <li>Critique — The "jump to recipe" button is at the top right below the title and didn't stick out to me as much as the other websites I looked at, and I think this feature is pretty important for anyone who wants to skip the intro and get right into making the recipe</li>
          <li>Critique — Didn't space out the visuals and the instructions — some of the visuals show the preparation of the cake, and it would've been nice to see the image that corresponds to each step</li>
