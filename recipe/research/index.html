        <h2>Title: Foolproof Macaron Recipe</h2>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
          French macarons are delicate almond meringue cookies with crisp shells and soft, chewy centers.
          While they're known for being tricky, using a Swiss meringue makes the batter more stable and
          reliable. This method simplifies the process and gives perfectly smooth, chewy macarons every time.

        <ul>
          <li>100g egg whites</li>
          <li>100g granulated sugar</li>

          <li>100g powdered sugar</li>
          <li>Pinch of salt</li>
          <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For the Filling:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
          <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 300°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
          <li>
            Heat a small pot of water over medium-low heat until it steams. In the bowl of a stand mixer,
            combine egg whites and roughly 3 tablespoons of the granulated sugar. Place bowl over steaming
            pot, creating a double boiler.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whisk egg whites and sugar continuously until sugar melts completely and egg whites become white
            and frothy, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and place the bowl back onto the stand mixer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fit stand mixer with whisk attachment and whisk on high speed while slowly adding in the remaining
            granulated sugar. Add the food coloring (if using). Continue to whisk for another 3-4 minutes,
            until stiff meringue peaks form. Congratulations, you just made a Swiss meringue!
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, sift together the almond flour, powdered sugar, and salt twice, then gently shake the
            mixture into the meringue bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the bowl back onto a stand mixer, still fitted with a whisk attachment. Turn the mixer to
            medium speed and whisk for 5 seconds (just enough to combine the almond flour mixture with the egg
            whites).
          </li>
          <li>
            Stop the mixer and use a large spatula to hand-mix the batter for the remainder of your mixing.
            You'll want to gently fold the mixture with your spatula, scooping up the batter from the outside
            of the bowl and gently twisting it into the center in a circle-like manner. You'll know to stop
            mixing when you can make a figure-eight out of the dripping batter without the batter breaking. If
            you cannot yet make a figure-eight, repeat the process if necessary, and try the figure-eight
            again. The best way to describe the perfect consistency is like slow moving lava. It should give,
            but only slightly, like in slow-motion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once your batter is the correct consistency, scoop it into a large pastry bag fitted with a 1 inch
            tip. Pipe silver dollar-sized circles onto prepared baking sheets, keeping about 1.5 inches
            between each meringue. Bang baking sheet on counter two times to remove any air bubbles. Sprinkle
            tops with a little sea salt as a garnish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the macarons air dry for 15 to 30 minutes or until dry to the touch. Just pop them into the
            prepared oven for 13 minutes, turning around halfway through, then allow to cool completely before
            removing from baking sheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the macarons are cooling, make the filling. Combine all filling ingredients in a bowl and
            use an electric mixer to beat until fluffy and fully combined, about 2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoop mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 1/2 inch tip and set aside until ready to assemble
            the macarons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the macarons are completely cool to the touch, pipe the filling onto a macaron and sandwich
            with another macaron. Repeat with all macarons.
          </li>
        </ol>

            There are quick options to share or print the recipe, and the two column layout of ingredients on

        <ul>
          <li>Great visuals, the images help you visualize what each step is supposed to look like</li>
          <li>
            I like how the ingredients list has checkboxes next to each ingredient so you can keep track of
            everything as you're preparing the cake batter/ganache/whipped cream
          </li>

            Critique — The "Jump to Recipe" button is at the top right below the title and didn't stick out to
            me as much as the other websites I looked at, and I think this feature is pretty important for
            anyone who wants to skip the intro and get right into making the recipe
          </li>
          <li>
            Critique — Didn't space out the visuals and the instructions — some of the visuals show the
            preparation of the cake, and it would've been nice to see the image that corresponds to each step

        <h1>Non-Recipe Website References & Rationale</h1>
        <h2><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The design places a lot of emphasis on the visually appealing images</li>
          <li>
            Strong black-and-white palette creates clear contrast, and yellow accents direct attention to key
            content
          </li>
          <li>
            The use of repeating elements, such as the article card layouts featured under the "Today's Picks"
            section, establishes consistency and makes the website easy to scan
          </li>
          <li>
            Related elements like the image, headline, and description are grouped closely together, which
            immediately makes it clear what content goes together
          </li>
          <li>The grid-based alignment keeps the images and text structured across all sections</li>
          <li>Sans-serif font is very readable for the screen</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Application to my website:</strong> I can use repeated recipe section layouts and strong
            contrast to help users quickly scan the ingredients, steps, and other notes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a href="https://phia.com/about/">Phia</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Generous use of white space gives the website lots of breathing room</li>
          <li>Very polished look</li>
          <li>
            Uses italics to create emphasis and make the user pause on certain words, and uses different font
            sizes to create hierarchy
          </li>
          <li>
            Consistent spacing, typography, and the styles of the visuals reinforce the Phia brand and create
            a cohesive look and feel
          </li>
          <li>
            Effective use of two-column image and text layouts creates balance, while the use of centered text
            helps capture the user's attention
          </li>
          <li>
            Small pops of color to make the website visually interesting and hold the user's attention without
            being overwhelming
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Application to my website:</strong> I want my page's visual style to match the vibe of the
            dish or dessert the recipe is for, and I'll use white space and intentional alignment to create a
            polished feel.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clean choice of typography</li>
          <li>
            The clear hierarchy between headlines, subheadings, and body text distinguishes levels of
            information
          </li>
          <li>
            Shows a lot of information on the screen at once without being too overwhelming for the user to
            look at/scan
          </li>
          <li>Side bar is helpful for navigation</li>
          <li>
            Related content is grouped logically, and the repeated article layout makes it easy to scan the
            content
          </li>
          <li>Left-aligned text improves readability</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Application to my website:</strong> I can apply similar hierarchy and grouping to present
            the recipe information clearly without overwhelming the user, and I could put the ingredients list
            in the same position as the left navbar on the Medium website so users can easily find the
            ingredients list without scrolling.
