        <span class="label">Desktop Variation 1</span>
        <div class="description">
          This desktop layout begins with a prominent image of the finished macarons spanning the width of the
          screen, followed by the title "foolproof macaron recipe" and a brief description. Below this, three
          distinct boxes provide a recipe overview, allergen information, and storage instructions. The main
          body of the page is split into two columns. The left column is a sticky sidebar that remains visible
          as the user scrolls, containing a "keep screen awake" toggle, a serving size adjuster, and
          checklist-style sections for both ingredients and equipment. The right column is a scrollable list
          of numbered, step-by-step instructions. Each step includes a heading, detailed descriptive text, and
          one or more associated images, all contained within a rectangular panel.

      <section class="prototype-section mobile-variation">
        <span class="label">Mobile Variation 1</span>
        <div class="description">
          The mobile layout starts with a large, full-width background image of macarons with the title
          overlaid. Below this, compact informational boxes display recipe details like time, yield, and
          difficulty, followed by a overall description of the recipe, allergen info, and storage info. Just
          below the "keep screen awake" toggle and serving size adjuster, the page has two collapsible
          accordion sections for ingredients and equipment, which saves vertical space. When either of these
          accordion sections is expanded, a checklist will appear. The cooking instructions are presented as a
          scrolling list of numbered steps. To improve readability on a smaller screen, every other step's
          section is shaded gray, helping to visually distinguish them. Each step includes a heading,
          instructions, and relevant images.

        <span class="label">Desktop Variation 2</span>
        <div class="description">
          This desktop design features a central image at the top, followed by the recipe title and a "jump to
          recipe" button. Below the description of the overall recipe, there is a horizontal bar detailing
          recipe times, yield, and difficulty. This is followed by allergen and storage information, a serving
          size adjuster, and a "keep screen awake" toggle. Ingredients and equipment are listed in two
          side-by-side checklist boxes. A progress bar indicates the five stages of the recipe: prep, Swiss
          meringue, macaronage, pipe/bake, and assemble. The main instructions are presented in a carousel
          format. Users can navigate through numbered steps using back and forward arrows, with each step
          displaying its heading, images, and detailed description on a single screen.

      <section class="prototype-section mobile-variation">
        <span class="label">Mobile Variation 2</span>
        <div class="description">
          This mobile layout mirrors its desktop counterpart with a top-centered image, title, and "jump to
          recipe" button. Following a description of the recipe, there is a grid panel with recipe time,
          yield, and other details. Below this are sections for allergy info, storage, a "keep screen awake"
          toggle, and a serving size adjuster. Ingredients and equipment are listed sequentially in a checkbox
          list. The instructions are presented in a card-like carousel with navigation arrows and a progress
          indicator that tells you what step you're on, such as "Step 2/15". Each step is shown individually,
          including its heading, detailed instructions, and associated images, allowing the user to focus on
          one task at a time. The user will also be able to swipe through each step to get to the next one.
